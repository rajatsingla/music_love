# Selenium script for running jango.com on restricted network

If you are on a network which block ads and station on jango.com keeps going off air.
Then this is the script for you. Which reloads automatically if station has gone off air.

## Getting Started

For ubuntu

- Download chromedriver from

  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads     
  *make sure chromedriver and your chrome version are compatible*

- Run following

```
sudo pip install selenium
mv /home/ubuntu/Downloads/chromedriver /usr/bin/
chmod +x /usr/bin/chromedriver
```

- Then everyday at  1100 hours run `python eminem.py`

Note: If you are not a eminem fan make a new file and add your fav jango station url there.
