# Selenium script for automating jango.com

If you are on a network which block ads and station on jango.com keeps going off air.
Then this is the script for you. Which reloads automatically if station has gone off air.

## Getting Started

For ubuntu
```
sudo pip install selenium
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
*make sure chromedriver and your chrome version are compatible*
mv /home/ubuntu/Downloads/chromedriver /usr/bin/
chmod +x /usr/bin/chromedriver
python eminem.py
```

Note: If you are not a eminem fan make a new file and add your fav jango station url there.
